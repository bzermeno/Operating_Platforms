Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?<br>
The Gaming Room client wanted software designed to support their multiplayer game, Draw It or Lose It, which is similar to the game Pictionary<br>
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?<br>
I believe that I sucessfully translated the client’s needs into clear, detailed documentation, ensuring the requirements were well defined and mapped out precisely.<br>
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?<br>
Working through the UML diagram provided me with a structured approach to the code development.<br>
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?<br>
I would focus on refining the user interface (UI) design and enhancing scalability. Improving these aspects would create a more user-friendly experience and ensure the system could handle more users.<br>
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?<br>
I translated the client's needs into features such as session management, cross-platform compatibility, and real-time interaction.<br>
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?<br>
In future projects, I would consider using strategies Agile methodologies like breaking down the project into manageable tasks, and iterating on the design based on client feedback.<br>
